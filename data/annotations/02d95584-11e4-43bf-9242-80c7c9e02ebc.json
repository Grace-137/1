ANASA is the only cultural centre of African arts and cultures in Athens, founded by Michael, a second generation of Nigerian descent who was born and raised in Athens. Michael is an actor, musician and activist who implemented the idea of creating a cultural center inspired by initiatives, by young people of African origin born in Greece. The center was created in an effort to tackle racial prejudice, xenophobia and racism, through art and culture. The cultural Center empowers and supports young individuals who are members of the African Diaspora and Michael also teaches West African multi-rhythm and drumming (djembe, dundun) introducing African culture and heritage to the Greek society, including the Black communities."

              "text": "Kypseli being a home:  Kypseli is a typical example of a metropolitan neighbourhood, as it incorporates historical layers of urbanization, social mobility, migration flows, and contemporary trends in the reuse of space. In the 30s the area was developed by upper-class residents who created residences and later apartment buildings. The area was then subsequently shaped by waves of internal and international migration, from the arrival of refugees from Asia Minor to immigrants from Eastern Europe and the rest of the world. This composition led to a multicultural everyday life, where locals and immigrants coexist, redefining public space and forming new practices of urban life. However, the area also went through phases of decline, with abandoned or neglected properties, which then returned to the housing market, often thanks to immigrants who revitalized them by occupying them for cheap rent. Up till recently Kypseli was an isolated and invisible neighbourhood where most foreigners in Athens lived, the majority of which were of African descent. The neighbourhood was once seen unsafe and dangerous to walk around during night hours but the residents of the neighbourhood never gave up on Kypseli, making it one of the most colourful neighbourhoods in Athens, where you can still experience hospitality and community. A place with a plethora of artistic initiatives, studios, cafes and the most beautiful neoclassical buildings and oldest bars, diners and theatres in the center of Athens. Kypseli’s historical trajectory, from a \"good investment area\" to a zone of \"degradation\" and then back on the rise, is directly linked to contemporary gentrification processes, making Kypseli a living laboratory of urban complexity, where it once functioned as a \"ghetto\" for marginalized populations and today is part of gentrification trends, while still maintaining the microcosms that make it unique."

It became the starting point for a dialogue on the ways one can manage the difficulties of the pandemic; whether as an artist or a spectator. That same day was the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the World Poetry Day. These three elements were enough to empower the members of the project the AfroGreeks to transform the empty city of Athens into a stage that would host a day-long action honouring the important messages of the day, taking into consideration the protective measures for Covid-19.\nThe protagonists of the AfroGreeks project performed in multiple locations, each with its own significance. The actions were all recorded and broadcasted live for Athenians to watch from the comfort of their homes and practice social distancing during the covid pandemic.  This event is an example of how art always finds a way and can be used in innovative ways to restore closeness."

The center was created in an effort to tackle racial prejudice, xenophobia and racism, through art and culture.

In the 30s the area was developed by upper-class residents who created residences and later apartment buildings. The area was then subsequently shaped by waves of internal and international migration, from the arrival of refugees from Asia Minor to immigrants from Eastern Europe and the rest of the world. This composition led to a multicultural everyday life, where locals and immigrants coexist, redefining public space and forming new practices of urban life. However, the area also went through phases of decline, with abandoned or neglected properties, which then returned to the housing market, often thanks to immigrants who revitalized them by occupying them for cheap rent. Up till recently Kypseli was an isolated and invisible neighbourhood where most foreigners in Athens lived, the majority of which were of African descent. The neighbourhood was once seen unsafe and dangerous to walk around during night hours but the residents of the neighbourhood never gave up on Kypseli, making it one of the most colourful neighbourhoods in Athens, where you can still experience hospitality and community. A place with a plethora of artistic initiatives, studios, cafes and the most beautiful neoclassical buildings and oldest bars, diners and theatres in the center of Athens. Kypseli’s historical trajectory, from a \"good investment area\" to a zone of \"degradation\" and then back on the rise, is directly linked to contemporary gentrification processes, making Kypseli a living laboratory of urban complexity, where it once functioned as a \"ghetto\" for marginalized populations and today is part of gentrification trends, while still maintaining the microcosms that make it unique."

It became the starting point for a dialogue on the ways one can manage the difficulties of the pandemic; whether as an artist or a spectator. That same day was the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the World Poetry Day. These three elements were enough to empower the members of the project the AfroGreeks to transform the empty city of Athens into a stage that would host a day-long action honouring the important messages of the day, taking into consideration the protective measures for Covid-19.\nThe protagonists of the AfroGreeks project performed in multiple locations, each with its own significance. The actions were all recorded and broadcasted live for Athenians to watch from the comfort of their homes and practice social distancing during the covid pandemic.  This event is an example of how art always finds a way and can be used in innovative ways to restore closeness."

Black Greeks born in the center of Athens get their birth certificates issued in this building and they only return here when preparing their documents (editing name spelling, acquiring additional documentation missing in file system) to file for citizenship. So, having access to this building and performing on the roof top the song A Change is going to come,  is a great gesture of collective hope and resistance, to signal that the legal restriction and bureaucratic barriers shaping Black life in Greece are not permanent."

The artists on the call all agreed they aspire to work together more and they will continue to fight stereotypes and prejudices through art."

It became the starting point for a dialogue on the ways one can manage the difficulties of the pandemic; whether as an artist or a spectator. That same day was the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the World Poetry Day. These three elements were enough to empower the members of the project the AfroGreeks to transform the empty city of Athens into a stage that would host a day-long action honouring the important messages of the day, taking into consideration the protective measures for Covid-19.\nThe protagonists of the AfroGreeks project performed in multiple locations, each with its own significance. The actions were all recorded and broadcasted live for Athenians to watch from the comfort of their homes and practice social distancing during the covid pandemic.  This event is an example of how art always finds a way and can be used in innovative ways to restore closeness."

Black Greeks born in the center of Athens get their birth certificates issued in this building and they only return here when preparing their documents (editing name spelling, acquiring additional documentation missing in file system) to file for citizenship. So, having access to this building and performing on the roof top the song A Change is going to come,  is a great gesture of collective hope and resistance, to signal that the legal restriction and bureaucratic barriers shaping Black life in Greece are not permanent."

The artists on the call all agreed they aspire to work together more and they will continue to fight stereotypes and prejudices through art."
